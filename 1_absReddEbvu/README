Description
-----------

mp_absredDgaia.pro:
IDL/GDL program for a single-parameter fit of the reddening curve at
wavelengths w>0.33mic with unknown trigonometric distance D_Gaia. In
the program, the relative mass of dark dust is 55% within 1 gram of
dust.  The visual extinction is derived from the reddening at infinite
wavelengths of the best dust model fit Av=-E(oo). The C abundance in
dust of the amorphous carbon grains is treated as a single-free
parameter; other model parameters remain fixed. The relative
abundances used to compute the dust masses of various dust populations
(PAH, VSG, vSi, aC, aSi, small grains) are scaled to achieve a
gas-to-dust mass ratio of ~125. These dust abundances are verified to
be consistent with the observed element depletion (Hensley & Draine
2023), hence the model aligns with the amount of material available
for dust formation or the total dust mass. The luminosity distance is
calculated using the apparent Vmag and the absolute magnitude Mv of
the star.

crossec_Ebv.f: Fortran code for computing cross-sections and optical
depth using the dust model by Siebenmorgen R. (2023, A&A, 670A, 115)
for fixed amount of dark dust and given E(B-V). This file must be
compiled first. Compilation instructions and additional details are
provided in the file's header.

./Data_Redd2023_AA676_132_Tab4:
Includes reddening curves for the high-qualityfar UV selected
reddening curve sample by Siebenmorgen et al 2023, A&A, 676, A132, 292



- Setup
--------


1) Compile:
> gfortran -ffixed-line-length-132 -O5 crossec_Ebv.f sigtDark_Ebv.f -o a.crossec_Ebv

2) Start IDL using:
> idl istart  
Alternatively, add the necessary libraries to your PATH:

!PATH = './AAstron/:' + !PATH  
!PATH = './Coyote/:'  + !PATH  
!PATH = './MPFIT/:'   + !PATH


- Example 
---------

Fit a Single Star: 
mp_absreDEbvu, 'HD315023' , 0.361, Vmag=10.03, Mv=-2.28,  /ps



An IDL script to run the reddening curve fit for the sample:
.r RunAll


- Results
The results will be saved in the ./Result/ directory.
