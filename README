AbsreDgaia:
For fitting absolute reddening curves with Av computed for given
reddening E(Bâˆ’V), V-band, absolute brightness Mv, and the
trigonometric distance Dgaia of the star.



1_absReddEbvu:
A single-parameter dust model fit of the absolut reddening curve at
wavelengths w>0.33mic with unknown trigonometric distance D_Gaia.
